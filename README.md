# TicTacToe
A small project to start applying what I've learned of SDL so far.

It's just a game of Tic Tac Toe, the main purpose of this project is to start implementing SDL,
and start organizing projects in multiple source files.

Since this doesn't have any makefiles and it's a small project, you'll have to compile all the source files into an executable, it has to be in the same directory as the /resources folder to be able to work.
